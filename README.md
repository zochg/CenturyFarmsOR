# GeoVizProject



**Topic**

​            For mystory-mapping project, I am curious about mapping the extent of farmlands andtypes of agriculture, potentially including ranching, in Oregon throughout itshistory as a state in the US. I am interested in mapping the inception, spread,and consolidation of family farms in Oregon, particularly the WillametteValley. One potential avenue worth pursuing would to examine the histories of“Century Farms” in Oregon, farms which have been in operation for over 100years.

**Audience**

​	I feel that this project could be of use to policy makers interested in
keeping family farms running, instead of being sold to large corporate
interests which homogenize and consolidate the industry, reducing the number of
jobs and creating possibilities for large-scale failure. By understanding when
and where family farms were created in Oregon, and by understanding when they
began to disappear and where, it may be possible to prevent further dissolution
of family farms.
